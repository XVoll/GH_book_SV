The aim for the SDGs to be attained “everywhere” means that no one should be left behind. Therefore, populations at subnational levels and local heterogeneities are to be taken into account in national statistics, ensuring representative monitoring and optimised intervention planning. Mapping with great detail the geographic distribution of populations, of their chararacteristics and of the SDG indicators is hence a central tool for meeting the SDGs. National households surveys are typically representative at the regional level (administrativel level 1). However, the households conditions may vary at much finer scale. For instance, poverty level within a town and in rural areas of the same region can differ markedly. Similarly, poverty between rural towns and the neigbourings hamlet can exhbit large differences while local economic activities (e.g. the presence or absence of a manufacture) can largely determine SDGs outcomes. Information at higher resolution is hence required to support the efficient allocation of ressources across territories and the monitoring of SDG indicators. Conventional approaches to producing high resolution development indicators rely on Small Area Estimation (SAE) methods integrating household survey with census data to estimate the proportion of households in poverty. Household surveys, conducted every 1 to 5 years, have been improved through the introduction of geolocated survey clusters providing more fine-grained spatial data thanks to global positioning systems (GPS). In El Salvador, the national household survey Encuesta de Hogares de Propositos Multiples (EHPM) is conducted on an annual basis. Censuses, on the other hand, are typically undertaken irregularly, sometimes up to every 10 years, or longer in many low-income countries. In El Salvador, the last census was conducted in 2007. The reliance on the latter weakens the reliability of population estimates, preventing an ongoing monitoring of SDG indicators. Geo-referenced national household survey data provide an opportunity to achieve more spatially detailed, accurate and regular estimates of poverty distribution. To further improve these estimates, novel sources of spatial data are increasingly being utilised to fill in the outdated census gap. Continually collected information such as rainfall, temperature and vegetation, also called remote sensing and geographic information system data (RS), capture information related to agricultural productivity, while light at nights and distance to roads and cities refects access to markets and information and local economic dynamism. Spatial interpolation approaches consist of overlapping such data with more traditional sources such as survey-based data in order to produce regularly-updatable high-resolution maps of development indicators. Here we use spatial interpolation methods by integrating household survey cluster data with geospatial covariates to produce high-resolution poverty, income and literacy maps for El Salvador. This technical report provides a tutorial for how such methods can be used in this space, outlining the relevant data, how they can be processed, analysis and interpreted in the context of poverty, household income and literacy. The emphasis is put on providing reproducible codes and exemples. This report is hence foremost a coding tutorial for creating high resolution map of SDG indicators. All the RS data are open source. All codes to go from the raw data to high resolution mapping are provided as an attachement. This report is written with the Markdown (Allaire et al. 2019) and the bookdown (Xie 2016) packages. The tutorial assumes that the reader is familiar with the open source statistical computing environment R. For a introductory book on using R, refer to https://cengel.github.io/R-intro/.
