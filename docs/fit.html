<h1><span class="header-section-number">Section 5</span> Fit the model</h1>
<p>In this section we fit the model for income, literacy and poverty. This can be summarized in the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parametrization of the spatial dependence structure</li>
<li>Standardization of the covariates</li>
<li>Dimension reduction of set of covariates with the Jacknife approach</li>
<li>Test of the goodness of fit of the model</li>
</ul>
<p>The covariates selection with the Jacknife approach is described, but the code is not run as it takes approximately 72 hours to complete.</p>

<p>The model appears to do relatively good job, although it has difficulty to capture the <em>segmentos</em> with an income above 400 despite the inclusion of the canton binary variable for canton with average income above 400. An option would be to control for these segmentos explicitly. However, we do not have a list of <em>segmentos</em> with income above 400 which include also the <em>segmentos</em> were the EHPM survey was not implemented.</p>
<p>The RMSE is 48 usd in the validation set while the the r-squared is 46%, so relatively good.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.4.5</span> Repeat step 2 to 4 once for each covariate</h3>
<p>We repeat steps 2 to 4 for each covariate, i.e. estimate the model 23 times. It took 29 second to estimate one model, hence we can expect to need circa 11 minutes to go through the 23 covariates.</p>
<p>In order to ease the reading of the code, we create a function <code>INLA_steps_2_4</code> implementing steps 2 to 4 of the covariate selection process.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.5.2</span> <em>Municipio</em> level</h3>
<p>The EHPM is representative at the <em>municipio</em> level for a subset of the <em>mucipios</em>. We can hence compare the goodness of fit of the model in representative and non representive <em>municipios</em>.</p>
<p>First we compute the average income level on the entire sample at the municipio level. We then compute the average prediction of the test set at the <em>municipio</em> level. Finally, we compare observed average income agains predicted average income at the <em>municipio</em> level, both for the representative and non-representative <em>municipios</em>.</p>
